# Iris Data Set
This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. 
Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. 
(See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each,
where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from 
the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

## Goal
* This repository aiming for getting familiar with fundamental unsupervised leanring algorithm throught **Iris data set**.

## Algorithm
* KMeans
* Spectral Clustering
* Hierarchical Cllustering
* DBSCAN

**Note:** I use these above cluster algorithms because I don't know how to train other clustering model to return number of cluster as 3 that equal to 
species in Iris dataset
